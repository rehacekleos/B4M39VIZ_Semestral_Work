# B4M39VIZ_Semestral_Work
Semestral work for a subject B4M39VIZ on OI FEL ČVUT.

## Visualization of airline travel in the USA
### Assignment
Load this [network](https://gephi.org/datasets/airlines.graphml.zip) in the [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/primer/graphml-primer.html) format. Each node is representing an airport and each edge between two airports represents a flight from one airport to another. Each airport has its geographical location. Design and implement visualization that will allow us to identify the size of an airport (based on the number of flights) and to clearly see the flights between the airports.
